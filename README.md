# 1️⃣ First Python Project - Task Tracker 

This is my **first ever Python project** – a simple **daily task tracker** built using basic Python concepts like:

- Variables
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- Lists
- User input and output

------

## 🤔 What It Does

 The program helps you:
- Plan your daily tasks
- Track which tasks are completed
- Reflect on your goal based on how much you complete
